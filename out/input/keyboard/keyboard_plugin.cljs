(defn add-capture
  "By default when a key is pressed Phaser will not stop the event from propagating up to the browser.
  There are some keys this can be annoying for, like the arrow keys or space bar, which make the browser window scroll.

  This `addCapture` method enables consuming keyboard events for specific keys, so they don't bubble up the browser
  and cause the default behaviors.

  Please note that keyboard captures are global. This means that if you call this method from within a Scene, to say prevent
  the SPACE BAR from triggering a page scroll, then it will prevent it for any Scene in your game, not just the calling one.

  You can pass a single key code value:

  ```javascript
  this.input.keyboard.addCapture(62);
  ```

  An array of key codes:

  ```javascript
  this.input.keyboard.addCapture([ 62, 63, 64 ]);
  ```

  Or, a comma-delimited string:

  ```javascript
  this.input.keyboard.addCapture('W,S,A,D');
  ```

  To use non-alpha numeric keys, use a string, such as 'UP', 'SPACE' or 'LEFT'.

  You can also provide an array mixing both strings and key code integers.

  Parameters:
    * keyboard-plugin (Phaser.Input.Keyboard.KeyboardPlugin) - Targeted instance for method
    * keycode (string | integer | Array.<integer> | Array.<any>) - The Key Codes to enable event capture for.

  Returns:  Phaser.Input.Keyboard.KeyboardPlugin - This KeyboardPlugin object."

  The given argument can be either an existing Key object, a string, such as `A` or `SPACE`, or a key code value.

  Parameters:
    * keyboard-plugin (Phaser.Input.Keyboard.KeyboardPlugin) - Targeted instance for method
    * key (Phaser.Input.Keyboard.Key | string | integer) - Either a Key object, a string, such as `A` or `SPACE`, or a key code value.

  would return an object containing the properties (`up` and `down`) mapped to W and S {@link Phaser.Input.Keyboard.Key} objects.

  You can also pass in a comma-separated string:

  ```javascript

  Which will return an object with the properties W, S, A and D mapped to the relevant Key objects.

  To use non-alpha numeric keys, use a string, such as 'UP', 'SPACE' or 'LEFT'.

  Parameters:

  For example, to listen for the Konami code (up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, b, a, enter)
  you could pass the following array of key codes:

  ```javascript
